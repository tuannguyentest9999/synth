            Synth allows data to be expressed as code, in a simple intuitive
            schema which defines constraints, relations and semantics in data
            generations. The schema is written in simple JSON files which can be
            checked into version control, reviewed for correctness and shared
            with external parties.
          </div>
          <div className="text-gray-400 font-medium">
            Synth integrates with relational and NoSQL databases, enabling data
            to be imported and create the scaffolding of the schema for you.
